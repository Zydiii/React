   In the era of information, web industry is becoming dramatically ubiquitous. To be successful, effective in this contemporary age it is essential to keep pace with skyrocketing technologies. We can't deny the fact that what tool is chosen is of significance.
   In computing, ***React*** (also known as ***React.js*** or ***ReactJS***) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  It is maintained by facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. Let's take a glance at its history.

# History
* 2011, React was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed.
* 2012, React was deployed on *Instagram.com*.
* 2013, React was open-sourced at JSConf US.
* 2015, *React Native* was announced at Facebook's React.js Conf and open-sourced.
* 2017, Facebook announced a new core algorithm of React framework library for building user interfaces named *React Fiber*.
# So, what is React?
   React is leading, well-drafted, widely applicable JavaScript technology. It combines the speed of JavaScript and uses a new way of rendering webpages, making them highly dynamic and responsive to user input.
   React has already hit the point of being mainstream and is used by a number of large companies. Let's take a look at the React's Growth below. It illustrates that React gained traction in 2014 and grows at a rapid speed.

   Let’s take a closer look at React’s pros and cons.
# Pros of React
## 1. Easy to Learn and Understand
   React is easier to learn compared to other front-end frameworks. Programmers with basic programming knowledge can easily understand React. When dealing with React, the basic programming knowledge we need to possess is HTML, JS and CSS.
## 2. Simple framework
   React is simpler to use than many frameworks or libraries. The well-defined lifecycle and component-based approaches helps to build and support professional mobile and web applications. 
## 3. Reuse of Components
   Webmasters can now use codes of different levels anytime and this saves time. With react, it is easier to manage updates for all the components of the system are completely isolated. Changes initiated in any of the components will not affect the others.
## 4. One-direction Data Flow 
   React uses just one direction data flow-downward. There is no way that child elements can affect the parent data. In the same way, only components permitted will also be upgraded. This maintains code stability.
## 5. Wide React Toolset
   React comes with a decent set of related tools that make a developer's life easier. React Developer Tools extension for Chrome allows for examining component hierarchies in the virtual DOM and editing states and properties. Additionally, we can check React Sight that visualizes state and prop trees.
# Cons of React
## 1. Poor Documentation
   New tools are being released every now and then, making documentation more difficult. Many webmasters struggle with implementing or integrating these latest tools with React. At the end, developers struggle with integrating these tools with ReactJS.
## 2. High Pace of Development
>   *“In case you didn’t notice we’re driving a car here with two flat tires, the hood just flew up in front of the windshield, and we have no clue what’s going on anymore!”*
>
>                                       —— *Michael Jackson and Ryan Florence*

  The environment constantly changes, and developers must regularly relearn the new ways of doing things. Everything is evolving, and some developers are not comfortable with keeping up with such a pace.
## 3. Unreadable and Unmanageable Componets
  React components can become unreadable and unmanageable in the long run. You may find there are too many helper render functions, too many component specific functions with lots of code, spaghetti code using a mix of state and props, and various call to state management libraries. You just cannot read the JSX part of the component and more or less understand what is rendering.
## 4. Folder Structure
  As the project becomes bigger,  with React you might need to open 4–5 files to make changes if the proper architecture is not followed from the start.
# React or not to React?

  To find an answer to this question is hard and difficult for there are numerous admirers and haters. Considering React js pros and cons, the point, nevertheless, was to showcase the usefulness of the React library in creating modern, scalable applications. With users more quick to choose alternatives in the case of poor application performance, product developers have to make an important judgment call when deciding the ‘right’ framework for creating the best looking and performing application to drive user leads and then monetary sales, eventually.
