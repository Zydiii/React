### 2. What is React?
 * A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
 * Declarative
 * Component-based
 * Technology stack agnostic

### 3. Getting Started with React
 * yarn global add create-react-app@1.5.2 
 * cd ...
 * create-react-app confusion 
 * yarn start
### 4. Configuring React Application
 * yarn add bootstrap@4.0.0
 * yarn add reactstrap@5.0.0  react-popper@0.9.2
### 5. React Element
 * Smallest building blocks of React apps
    `const element = <h1 calssName = "App-title">Welcome to React</h1>;`
 *  Plain JS Object taht are cheap to create
 * Components are made of elements
    `class App extends Component{...}`
 * **classname not class**
 * `ReactDOM.render()`
### 6. Rendering to the DOM
 * Rendered using ReactDOM. See index.js
    `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));`
 * Where is is rendered? index.html
     `<div id="root"></div>`
    Root DOM node
### 7. Introduction to JSX
 * Syntactic extension to JavaScript
 * Shorthand notation to represent JavaScript functions calls that evaluate to JavaScript objects
 * Avoids artificial separation of rendering logic from other UI logic
### 8. React Components Overview
* A component returns a set of React elements that should appear on the screen
* Components enable you to split your UI into independent, reusable pieces
* Components also accept inputs
* Different kinds of components can be defined in React
* User-defined component names must always start with a capital letter
* Tags starting with lowercase letters are treated as DOM tags

* Media
### 9. State
*  Each component can store its own local information in its "state"
*  Private and fully controlled by the component
*  Can be passed as props to children
*  Only class components can have local state
*  State declared within the constructor 
* State declared within the constructor:
``` javascript
    class Menu extends Component{
          constructor(props){
              super(props);
                  
              this.state = {
                   selectedDish:null
              }
          }
    }
```
* State should only be modified using setState()
``` 
    onDishSelect(dish){
        this.setState({
            selectedDish:dish
        });
    }
```
* Never do the following:
```
    this.state.selectedDish = dish;
```
### 10. Props
* JSX attributes are passed into a component as a single object
* Available in the component as "peops"
* Can pass in multiple attributes
* Cannot modify props within the component
* Examles:
```
    <Menu dishes = {this.state.dishes}>
    <Dishdetail dish = {this.state.dish} comments = {this.state.comments}>
```
### 11. Handling Events
* Handleing events is similar to the way you handle events on DOM elements: Use camelCase to specify events; Pass function as the events handler
* Example:
`<Card onClick = {() => this.onDishSelect(dish)}>`
### 12. Lists and Keys
* Lists are handled similar to JS
* Example:
```
    const menu = this.props.dishes.map((dish)) =>{
        return(
              <div key={dish.id}>
              <h1>{dish.name}</h1>
              <p>{dish.description}</p>
              </div>
        );
    });
```
* Keys should be ginven to elements inside the array
* Keys identify which items have changed, are added or removed
### 13. Lifting State Up
* Sometimes several components may share the same data
* Changes to data in one component needs to be reflected to another component
* Best to move the shared state to a common ancestor component
### 14. React Component Lifecycle
* React Component goes throngh the following lifecycle stages: Monuting, Updating, Unmounting
* Several lifecycle methods available in each stage
### 15. Mounting Lifecycle Methods
* Called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
```
    Constructor()
    getDerivedStateFromProps()
    render()
    componentDidMount()
```
* An earlier method now deprecated called 
`componentWillMount()`
